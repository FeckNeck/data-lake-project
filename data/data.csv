3581210	male	33	InvestmentBanking	Aquarius	05/08/2004	I came across this in my daily readings of Korean news and sites...just trying to get a handle on this place. urlLink The anti-traditional Korean lady...holy crap, they look strong! And push-ups! More pics on urlLink the site (it's all in Korean, but no translation needed for the images. Now, I knew that Korean women are strong in spirit, but had not seen many like this. Most Korean men like their gals to be smaller, weaker (well, most guys do, it's just more prevalent here) so it takes real...um....balls for a gal to go into this sport. I don't mind it, myself. Maybe because even when muscle-bound Korean women still look relatively dainty--at least compared to their Western-lady body-building counterparts who start to look a little horsey.
3539003	female	14	indUnk	Aries	05/06/2004	Look at me. Look at my eyes. You see a tear. Now look into my eyes as I gaze aimlessly into yours. Grief, hope, anguish, love. I know you can see it all. We lock each other in a stare, trying to freeze us in this moment. A conversation passes between us, but no words are spoken. Unsure of what to do next, I run my fingers through your hair. Then we hug. This position once so odd now becomes the most comforting thing in my entire world. Then the bell rings. Yes... the bell. Once it was my savior and now I am betrayed by the bell. We stand hand in hand as the world goes on around us. I tell you I love you. You say it back. I weekly say good-bye. I walk away, only twenty steps away. I look back to see you watching me... A fading memory. I run back and kiss you. A perpetual kiss. When we part and walk away, the warmth remains on our lips. You take with you a huge part of my life. Not only do you have my entire heart, you have my first kiss too. Remember me fondly forever, because I will never forget you. I love you. Good-bye.
3539003	female	14	indUnk	Aries	11/08/2004	You may be wondering why my site is called 'Spaghetti Wall'. It is a joke between me and some friends. We went on the Washington D.C. trip with my school. We were at a nice Italian restraunt and I got plain spaghetti noodles. One of my friends pointed out that if the noodles were cooked, they'd stick to the wall. She grabbed a handful and sure enough, the spaghetti stuck to the wall! For some reason, I couldn't pick the noodles off the wall with my fingers. I couldn't get a hold of them. What else could I do? I ate the spaghetti of the wall! Everybody though it was so funny! Do you remember the 'Spaghetti Wall'?
4172416	female	25	indUnk	Capricorn	08/08/2004	Election time has rolled around again. And everyone is spitting their venom at each other in hopes of impressing the public with their 'tact'. Um..what. Instead of pointing your greedy little fingers and accusing Mr So and So, why don't you do one better, and tell us what YOU'RE going to do for us. Im sick of hearing what he did, how badly they did it, or how they didnt but should have. Says YOU. I guess it isnt like anyone is bound to believe anything you white collared putzs have to say anywya. You always do the opposite. I've been trying to educate myself on the different political platforms to figure out which I can identify with most. Personally, for some, I think lying would gather more votes. Shit, no wonder the libertarians never make it into office. To blatantly state 'We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating AFDC, food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.' ...is a ballsy move. Oh? You thought that was it? Theres more: 'The bulk of your welfare tax dollars goes to pay the handsome salaries of well-educated welfare workers. The poor get little from government welfare except meager handouts and a cycle of despair.' Again...ummmm, what? So, let me get this right....government should stop paying the 'meager handouts' to families in need, and instead have those families go begging churches and charities for even smaller handouts..because...those 'meager' handouts are causing the moneywell to go dry? But hey, it's ok to throw cash at foreign countries and help THEIR people out. Who cares that most of them deteste the United States, and somewhere in their hearts pray for our annihilation. I bet those little bastards setting our flag on fire and stomping all over it after 9/11, aren't aware that our money covered their birth. Nothing better than paying for the future of terrorism. Maybe i'm taking this personally, as I should. Because without the ever so popular 'welfare system'. My mother and myself might have suffered. Blah. I can see you all thinking that your precious greens have in some way helped me become the fine young woman I am today. BZZZZZZZT. Think again. The sum of monies my mother received could be accounted for with taxes paid out from my immediate family alone. She could have been on welfare for another 20 years, and technically, taxes paid by my extended families would have covered it. So i'll just thank them, and give you the middle finger for being arrogant enough to think that you have had any impact on my families financial prosperity. And now the shoe is on the other foot, or however it goes, and my taxes are paying for your sisters-mothers-best-friends-brother-nieces illegitimate kids. And to ease your silent curiousity, my mother is now a very successful businesswoman. So suck my tampon string. Here is another Liberal issue, surely the cure to the nations healtcare AND war on drugs. Let's just legalise it!!! It's typical of the liberal party to promote the legalisation of drugs isn't it. I mean, for their stance on issues alone, they have to be smoking or snorting something. The liberals take on anything seems to be 'We can't control it so lets just legalise it and save ourselves the time and money it would take to correct it.' If you see it that way, you're a plain idiot. Does rehabiliation not cost money? Do damages not cost money? Ok, give some kid easy access to some pot, so they can fall asleep at the wheel and crash into a building. Or kill someone. 'Drugs should be legal. Individuals have the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies, so long as they take responsibility for their actions.' Ok, well when these users are irresponsible and their actions endanger other people, .. THEN WHAT? Let me guess, have their parents bear the responsibility. Riiight. 'Addicts out of control were a tiny minority.' Um...So was obesity. See how thats change. And food IS legal! I can almost picture it...1972, after a demonstration on public sex, and the art of smoking pot through your girlfriends vagina, a group of teenage dropouts were arrested and spent a night in jail where they concocted this notion that if everything were legalised, the standard of their living would be improved and fuck consequences of drug induced peoples, fuck work performance, fuck cost of consequences, fuck everyone else. And the liberal party was formed.
4030905	female	17	Student	Aries	30/07/2004	Such a boring day. I have no comments. I found out that I'm the shortest girl in my class. Had very healthy food today. I shall not mention what they are. Cos I can't be bothered to do so right now.
3705830	male	25	Non-Profit	Cancer	23/06/2004	"in a moment of clarity i looked up the tablature for 'tightrope', by the stone roses. a truly beautiful wonderful song, and one that i have every intention of playing at some point when the mysterious 'band' gets together. acoustic singalongs were never so cool: are we etched in stone, or just scratched in the sand waiting for the waves to come and reclaim the land? and then, in a moment of complete insanity, i looked up the tablature for 'good times', by the stone roses. why? delusions of adequacy, and nothing more. oh my good god, there is no way i will ever ever learn to play that. [aside: i probably could, but it would need to be a full-time job and i'm fairly sure no-one's going to pay me for that, alas.] i get as far as 0:26 and then its into the main riff and i've no space to fit all those notes in. it brings up the issue of 'the second coming', though, which is a vastly underrated album in my opinion. to have those two completely different songs next to each other and to have it work is an indication of something, even if five years is a long time to wait. definitely worth having; good summer guitar tunes. disregarding the rain, that is. interesting fact: on the set of '24 hour party people', i met the fake john squire - that is, the actor playing john squire in the film. and yet, he doesn't appear in the film at all. shame; he had good john squire hair. presumably left on the cutting room floor... n."
4120194	female	17	Arts	Aries	18/08/2004	Well today was eventful... in an everyday sort of way. I woke up this morning and decided to get my shopping for my trip over with so I'm not doing it last minute. I drag Ryden along to the mall with me and we look for a bathing suit. After about 30 minutes of searching today and about 3 weeks before hand we finally find one that we both agree on. Isn't it pathetic that we both have to agree on clothes before we buy them. I value his opinion on what I wear the most because he's the only one I dress for and try to look good for. So the bathing suit it purchased... and it was on sale yay!! and we walk through the mall and i buy a top and a purse. By the way it's taken me all summer to find a purse that I actually like. I've never even owned a purse before and it was getting to the point where I had so much shit to carry around that I decided I really needed one. I'm very picky on this subject because I personally don't like purses all that much (hence why i've never owned one) but after about 2 months I FINALLY found one I like. So shopping was then over. We head back home and sit down after 5 hours of wandering the mall, and watched the movie 'A Beautiful Mind'. This is now my favorite movie, next to 'Pirates Of The Carribean'.... I loved 'A Beautiful Mind' it's a truly amazing movie... wow. So after that we all went out to dinner, cause it was Whitney's birthday... the big one five. We went to Boston Pizza and it was really fun... Later on at Ryden's, he gives me this poem/piece of writing that he wrote about me. I would post it on here but i dont know if he would want me to... anyways i loved it ... it was cute. And thats all the news today
913315	male	25	Communications-Media	Aquarius	29/06/2004	"Technical Difficulties....to the Extreme! The recent lack of posts is due to a serious computer malfunction. It seems as if I need a complete overhaul, so things may be sporatic for a little while. Luckily, a good friend let me use his computer to put this up. On a happier note, I went to see urlLink The Ponys at Spaceland last night...FOR FREE. So to all you sucks who paid to see them at the Troubadour tonight, I'm better than you. Not that I wouldn't pay to see this band. They were great fun. The lead singer is like a really tall pogo stick, and the lead guitar looks like Andy Warhol (and he makes silly faces when the lead singer does something weird), there are two other people two, but they didn't do anything crazy that merits mentioning. They're a little indie rock band straight out of Chicago and the album has a cool cover too. So you should get it, so that they can pay their rent and make more music for you to listen to, since I'm obviously not helping any. Although I did tell them to 'go on with their bad selves' and I do beleive they took it to heart, and will remember that moment when they think they just can't go on any more. And remembering that will cause them to continue. urlLink Really bad phone camera photo of The Ponys at Spaceland.&nbsp; urlLink"
